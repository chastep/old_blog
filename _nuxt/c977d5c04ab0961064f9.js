You can find out more about me <a href="/info">here</a>. This is my blog and this is a blog post about me building it. The build process so far as resembled the photo above. How can I fit what I know (me) into a proven application that works, but I have limited experience utilizing (the mini cooper)? Surely there is a way, but it\'s my responsibiliy to learn how without damaging myself and/or the car!</p>\n<p>It\'s been an interesting process, but most importantly it\'s also an ongoing process. I plan to write further posts in the future, I just wanted to provide a list of applications/frameworks I\'ve been using recently to stand as a base for my work so far.</p>\n<h2>Languages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Markdown (for all blog posts)</li>\n<li>Javascript</li>\n<li>HTML/CSS</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Applications/Frameworks</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Git/Github (VCM and hosting, shoutout to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>)</li>\n<li><a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt.js</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I selected these languages and applications for a variety of reasons (which I plan to dive into more indepth at a later date), but overall I was influenced by a mixture of comfortability and exploration. I\'ve used some of these technologies a lot and some not at all. That\'s what life is though, using past learning experiences to better yourself in the future!</p>\n<p>These blog posts have the over-arching goal of providing an environment where I can distill my thoughts, vent, explain, and even talk through issues one might face when building anything. Thoughts might even branch into real world issues from time-to-time. Hope you find it as interesting and beneficial as I do.</p>\n'}}}]);
