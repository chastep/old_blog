Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chase. You can find out more about me [here](/info). This is my blog and this is a blog post about me building it. The build process so far as resembled the photo above. How can I fit what I know (me) into a proven application that works, but I have limited experience utilizing (the mini cooper)? Surely there is a way, but it's my responsibiliy to learn how without damaging myself and/or the car!

It's been an interesting process, but most importantly it's also an ongoing process. I plan to write further posts in the future, I just wanted to provide a list of applications/frameworks I've been using recently to stand as a base for my work so far.

Languages
------
- Markdown (for all blog posts)
- Javascript
- HTML/CSS

Applications/Frameworks
---
- Git/Github (VCM and hosting, shoutout to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/))
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)

I selected these languages and applications for a variety of reasons (which I plan to dive into more indepth at a later date), but overall I was influenced by a mixture of comfortability and exploration. I've used some of these technologies a lot and some not at all. That's what life is though, using past learning experiences to better yourself in the future!

These blog posts have the over-arching goal of providing an environment where I can distill my thoughts, vent, explain, and even talk through issues one might face when building anything. Thoughts might even branch into real world issues from time-to-time. Hope you find it as interesting and beneficial as I do.
