      Hi again! My name is Chase Stephens. Originally from Wisconsin and now based in Chicago, I've been a fulltime developer for the past ~3 years.
    </p>
    <p class="info-snippet">
      Ruby on Rails is my bread and butter. I love to get fancy with some React/Redux and good old-fashioned Javascript/Node as well.
    </p>
    <p class="info-snippet">
      Outside of work I spend my time staying active, trying to sniff out the best eats in the land, and tending to my apartment garden. I always appreciate an intriguing story, a good laugh, and a great cup of coffee.
    </p>
    <p class="info-thanks">
      Thanks for visting!
