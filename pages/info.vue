      Ruby on Rails is my bread and butter. I love to get fancy with some React/Redux and good old-fashioned Javascript/Node as well.

      Outside of work I spend my time staying active, trying to sniff out the best eats in the land, and tending to my apartment garden. I always appreciate an intriguing story, a good laugh, and a great cup of coffee.
